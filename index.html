                <p>
                    We were founded by a dude who justed wanted to bring old-school,
                    Bronx-style pizza to LA. You can decide if we achieved our goal.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We've been here in Santa Monica for
                    <span class="bold larger">25 years</span>,
                    and all that time,
                    we've been selling quality pizza at affordable prices. Whether
                    you want a single slice or a whole pie, we'll be sure to get
                    what you need.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Not to mention, we've been a proud part of the local community
                    serving students and commuters alike. Pretty sure 90% of
                    Santa Monica College students get their lunch here!
